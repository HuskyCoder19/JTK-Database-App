JTK Database is a small-scale database application written in C++. Data is stored in CSV files representing 
tables stored within directoires representing databases. The goal of JTK Database is to support CRUD operations
(Create, Read, Update, Delete) on data. The database app is currently being run through a command line interface
to operate on local data.

This project uses Cmake to build. To run, go to project root, create build directory, and run Cmake commands
within build directory on project root to create compiler. Run 'Cmake --build .' to create executable to run
the program.

This is a work in progress!!
